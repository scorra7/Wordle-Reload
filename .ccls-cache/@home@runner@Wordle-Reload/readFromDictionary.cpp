/* readFromDictionaryAndLookup.cpp
    Show how to read from a dictionary file into a vector.
   Running program looks like:
   
        Reading words in from dictionary
        Dictionary has 263533 words.
        Here are a few dictionary words:
           0. banding
           1. tenon
           2. evolutionarily
           3. khalifate
           4. infangthiefs
        The word at position 10 is: aardvarks and has length 9
        Two words are: abandoner and abstractionist.
        compareValue is: 0
